              Sleep Tracker provides (as you would expect) the ability to enter
              in the hours you slept during the night. While this isn't new
              technology by any means, it's clearly the most important feature!
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll enter this information by selecting the time you went to
              bed and the time you got up on a scroll wheel. The app will then
              calculate exactly how long you slept and store it in an entry for
              that day.
