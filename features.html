              Sleep Tracker provides (as you would expect) the ability to enter
              in the hours you slept during the night. It may not be
              groundbreaking technology, but it is certainly the most important
              feature of the app!
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll enter this information by selecting the date/time you went
              to sleep, and the date/time you woke up. The app will then
              calculate exactly how long you slept and store it in an entry for
              that day.

              When you wake up in the morning you'll be able to select one of 4
              emojis displaying how you're feeling that day. These range from
              exhausted to feeling great! This will also get stored with your
              sleep session in the app.

            <p>
              This is where the magic starts to happen. Without these ratings,
              this is just a sleep log. But once the application has an idea of
              how you're feeling after sleeping a certain number of hours,
              you'll get access to an analysis of how much sleep you need.

              One page of the application allows you to view all of your
              previous sleep entries, which is nice if you'd like to check your
              sleep length trends or find out when you went to sleep on a given
              night.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this page you are also able to edit and delete entries that
              may have been entered incorrectly. Your log will update
              immediately with the changes you've made to your sleep entries.

              Getting too much or too little sleep can be a hinderance on your
              productivity and energy levels the following day. Sleep Tracker
              aims to help you find the 30 minute window that has you feeling
              the best.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you've entered enough sleep data, your entries will be
              analyzed and you'll get a 30 minute window of sleep to aim for.
              This is calculated by looking at your mood ratings and how much
              sleep you got the night before in order to determine your personal
              needs.
