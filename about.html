            <h3>UI Developer</h3>
            <p>
              Barbara created the landing, about us, and features pages on the
              marketing site. Her favorite thing about coding is being able to
              make a site look just like her idea or a design sketch. In her
              free time, Barbara enjoys playing video games and doing jigsaw
              puzzles.

            <h2>Brian Russell</h2>
            <h3>Front End React Developer</h3>
            <p>
              Brian added all of the routing for the application, as well as
              built the login and signup pages. His favorite thing about coding
              is the way it feels like you're solving a puzzle. When he has
              spare time, Brian enjoys watching too many movies, playing guitar,
              and cooking.

            <h3>Front End React Developer</h3>
            <p>
              Victoria handled connecting the front and back ends, and also
              managed state throughout the application. Her favorite thing (or
              least favorite thing, maybe) about coding is spending 45 minutes
              debugging, but it was just a misplaced comma all along. She likes
              to cook in her free time, and enjoys gaming.

            <h2>Cody Denniston</h2>
            <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
            <p>
              Cody assisted with the creation of the API endpoints, formatted
              the data, and added authorization to the application. His favorite
              thing about coding is the moment when all your effort comes to
              fruition, and the app works the way you want it to. He enjoys
              running and playing video games in his spare time.
