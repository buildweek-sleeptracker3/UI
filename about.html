              Barbara created the landing, about us, and features pages on the
              marketing site. Her favorite thing about coding is being able to
              make a site look just like her idea or a design sketch. In her
              free time, Barbara enjoys playing video games and doing jigsaw
              puzzles.

              Brian added all of the routing for the application, as well as
              built the login and signup pages. His favorite thing about coding
              is the way it feels like you're solving a puzzle. When he has
              spare time, Brian enjoys watching too many movies, playing guitar,
              and cooking.

              Victoria handled connecting the front and back ends, and also
              managed state throughout the application. Her favorite thing (or
              least favorite thing, maybe) about coding is spending 45 minutes
              debugging, only to realize it was a misplaced comma all along. She
              likes to cook in her free time, and enjoys gaming.

              Cody assisted with the creation of the API endpoints, formatted
              the data, and added authorization to the application. His favorite
              thing about coding is the moment when all the effort comes
              together into a functional app. He enjoys running and playing
              video games in his spare time.

              Henry created the API endpoints and tests, as well as developed
              the authorization and data schema for Sleep Tracker. His favorite
              thing about coding is seeing the successful result at the end of
              all the hard work. Henry also runs a landscaping business on the
              side and enjoys trying out new things in his free time.
