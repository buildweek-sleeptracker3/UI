      <h2>Figuring Out your Perfect Sleep Schedule</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered how much sleep you need to function the following
        day? Do you know someone who needs a lot less (or a lot more!) sleep
        than you do? Sleep Tracker is here to help you determine just how much
        sleep you need each night to be at your best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how it works: you enter in the hours you sleep each night, as
        well as rate your energy levels throughout the day. After -- entries,
        you'll have access to an analysis of your sleep trends indicating just
        how many hours you need to feel rested and ready to take on the day
